The course content is free and open source, and hosted on GitHub. A link will be available *after the class* so that edits can be suggested via Pull Requests.

### Suggesting Changes to The Course Material

If you notice a typo or any other issues with the material *after the class*, please open a pull request on GitHub by clicking the "Edit this page" button on the top right corner of every course page.

{{% notice info %}}
The course material is heavy in information and links. I suggest that you follow the links **after class** as a source of additional information, so that you don't get distracted from the important material.
